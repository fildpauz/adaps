The 1st century BC started on January 1, 100 BC and ended on December 31, 1 BC. An alternative name for this century is the last century BC. The AD/BC notation does not use a year zero. Scientific notation does, however use a minus sign, so '2 BC' is equal to 'year −1'. [“1st century BC”]
During the summer months, the sun stays visible for a longer time, and sunset happens late in the day. For this reason, certain countries advance the time by one hour near the start of summer, and put it back one hour during autumn. The time during summer is called Daylight saving time (DST). [“Daylight saving time”]
Water is the most common liquid on Earth. It covers about 71.4% of the Earth. Pure water has no smell, taste, or color. If water gets very cold (below 0 degrees Celsius), it freezes and becomes ice. If water gets very hot (above 100 degrees Celsius), it boils and becomes steam. [“Water”]

In 1929 Hubble formulated what is called Hubble's law. The law states that the greater the distance between any two galaxies, the greater their relative speed of separation. Georges Lemaître, a Belgian priest and astronomer, had published the idea two years before in an obscure journal. Nevertheless, the idea bears Hubble's name to this day. [“Edwin Hubble”]
Oxygen (O) is a chemical element. In nature, oxygen is a gas with no color or smell. Oxygen is a very important element because it is a part of the air people breathe and the water people drink. [“Oxygen”]
