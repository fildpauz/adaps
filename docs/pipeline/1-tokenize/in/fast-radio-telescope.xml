On Sunday, China announced the attachment of the final panel to its telescope named Five hundred meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST). This piece marks the end of a five-year-long US$180 million (CNY¥1.2 billion) construction project.

FAST comprises about 4,500 panels and spans a diameter of 500 meters (about 1640 feet). The telescope is part of a series of ventures into space exploration by China, including planning another robotic Moon mission and creating a Chinese space station, with its core module set to be launched into space in 2018. With the country&apos;s founding centenary coming in 2049, Chinese President Xi Jinping said during a Beijing conference, &#8220;great scientific and technological capacity is a must for China to be strong&#8221;.

In order to achieve optimal electromagnetic performance for FAST with minimal signal interference, it was built in the South China Karst. This ultimately forced the relocation of about 9,100 inhabitants within a 3.1-mile (5km) radius of the telescope. The residents received about US$1,800 (CNY¥12,000) in reimbursement, with those experiencing difficulties with housing receiving about US$1,500 (CNY¥10,000) in extra compensation. The Chinese government supports the resettlement, with senior party official Li Yuecheng saying the relocation would provide a &#8220;sound electromagnetic wave environment&#8221;.

The telescope is now the largest-diameter single-dish radio telescope. It took the spot from the 305-meter diameter Arecibo Observatory telescope in Puerto Rico. Russia&apos;s RATAN-600 multi-element radio telescope has a diameter of 576 meters. This adds to China&apos;s record-defying achievements; it contains the world&apos;s largest bridge and the world&apos;s longest wall, the Great Wall of China.

The telescope is set to be ready for use in September. Its possible uses include exploration for pulsars, a special type of neutron stars detected through their emission of radio pulses. Scientists have also described the telescope&apos;s potential to explore alien civilization, with NAO Radio Astronomy Technology Laboratory director Peng Bo saying FAST&apos;s &#8220;potential to discover an alien civilization will be 5 to 10 times that of current equipment, as it can see farther and darker planets&#8221;.
