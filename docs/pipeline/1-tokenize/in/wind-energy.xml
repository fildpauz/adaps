Wind energy—that is, consumer energy provided by the conversion of wind power captured by high-technology windmills on large wind farms—seems like a very promising way to solve some of our energy needs.  At first glance, it seems to be a totally harmless source of energy: it is quiet, uses a resource that is completely renewable, and produces very little waste.  Therefore, it is not surprising that the development of wind energy is spreading [1]. However, energy production from wind farms is not without some risks. For instance, a large number of bats have been found dead at several wind farms. Studies show that the low pressure created by the spinning turbine blades causes bats&apos; lungs to burst [2]. This is a definite cost that needs to be taken into consideration as we build more wind farms. In addition, future research should focus on how to minimize these kinds of risks.
