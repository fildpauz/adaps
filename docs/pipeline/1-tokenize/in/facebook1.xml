In Phase 1, participants completed a set of questionnaires, which we modified to assess perceptions of Facebook support. We also assessed participants&apos; motivation for using Facebook. In Phase 2, participants were text-messaged 5 times per day between 10am and midnight over 14-days. Text-messages occurred at random times within 168-minute windows per day. Each text-message contained a link to an online survey, which asked participants to answer five questions [about their feelings and Facebook usage] using a slider scale. Participants returned to the laboratory following Phase 2 to complete another set of questionnaires. Participants&apos; number of Facebook friends was also recorded during this session from participants&apos; Facebook accounts.
