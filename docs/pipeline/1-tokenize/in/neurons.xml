Understanding a sentence that someone else utters may seem effortless to you, but it&apos;s actually a complex process because you have to parse that sentence into many parts to understand what it means. Speech consists of a hierarchy of components that each takes place on a different timescale. Speech cues such as intonation occur on a relatively long timescale, unfolding over hundreds of milliseconds. At the other end of the spectrum is the phoneme—the smallest unit of speech—which lasts only tens of milliseconds.

Similarly, distinct sets of neurons in the brain fire rhythmically at different rates, and these oscillations can also be arranged in a hierarchy. For instance, slow delta-wave oscillations can influence the magnitude of faster theta oscillations, which in turn can alter the amplitude of even faster gamma oscillations. Rhythmic brain activity plays an important role in a variety of cognitive processes, including attention, memory, and decision-making.
