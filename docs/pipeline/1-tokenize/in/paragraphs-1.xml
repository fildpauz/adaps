It&apos;s too fast to catch, spears smaller insects with spiny legs, and sings a song that mirrors the syllables of its name, &#8220;Ka-ty-did, Ka-ty-didn&apos;t.&#8221; Its music is so catchy, it has even been used as the chorus of popular songs.

Listroscelidinae are a group of insectivorous katydid hunters from South America whose fast and aggressive behavior makes them difficult to capture, let alone identify. According to the authors of a recent PLOS ONE study, these Neotropical katydids have been understudied, partly because we haven&apos;t been able to get our hands on them. However, the authors of this study managed to collect more than 100 specimens from one of the world&apos;s most threatened ecosystems, the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.
