The presented work challenges the predominant assumption of a unidirectional knowledge transfer based on an extensive user study with an autonomously interacting humanoid robot. We subscribe to a perspective present in research in social human-human interaction emphasizing the process of alignment between mental states, actions' goals, and communication... Subscribing to the interactive view in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), it is not the user alone who determines what is being demonstrated (Figure 1A) (as it is currently implicitly assumed in robot imitation learning) but the demonstration has to emerge with the feedback of the learner.

In current HRI, the interactive view on social cognition and communication has not been tested, because most robots are barely capable of a real interaction.
