Newton&apos;s third law: &#8220;For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.&#8221; This is best understood with billiard balls, where you can easily see the action/reaction pairs of forces. Likewise, when you kick a football, not only does the ball move, but you feel a force on your foot. [&#8220;Newton&apos;s laws of motion&#8221;]
