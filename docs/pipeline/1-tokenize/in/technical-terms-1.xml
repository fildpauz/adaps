Recently, we have seen image-sharing communities truly take off—sites such as Pinterest, Imgur and Tumblr, just to name a few. A key research challenge for communities like these is uncovering the mechanisms by which content spreads from person to person (or &#8220;diffuses,&#8221; adopting the term from the academic literature). For example, a study of the most widely shared New York Times stories found that they tend to “inspire awe” in their readers.
Drawing on a corpus of one million images crawled from Pinterest, we find that color significantly drives how far an image diffuses, even after partially controlling for user activity and network structure.
