Henry Cavendish (1731-1810) was a British scientist. He is famous for discovering hydrogen. Cavendish also claimed that the force between the two electrical objects gets smaller as they get further apart. If the distance between them doubled, the force would be one quarter what it was before. This was based on the inverse-square law.
